            <h2>Project Pegasus</h2>
                <p>Pegasus is a 10 kg vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft produced by the Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group (WARG).
                The quadcopter placed #1 out of 12 other UAVs at the Aerial Evolution Association of Canada in 2024. 
                I contributed to the mechanical design, manufacturing, and assembly of the airframe along with mounting hardware.
                I also represented the team at the 2024 competition (you can see me in the far left first row!).
                </p>
                <img src="./img/warg-pic.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Point Landing Gear</h3>
                <p>One of my first tasks in the team was to design a simple landing gear for the drone. I designed a vertical landing gear
                   with 4 touch points. The landing legs are vertical to eliminate bending moments at the t-joint that could snap the joint. The t-joint is 
                   3D printed using carbon fiber PETG filament for increased toughness. 10 mm diameter carbon fiber tubes are used for the legs
                   to conserve weight. A small notch at the 3D printed joint is used to promote landing gear failure at the joint in the event of a crash 
                   to protect the carbon fiber tubes.
                </p>

            <h4>Monster Mount</h4>
                <p>
                    The 'monster mount' is an integrated sensor mount that accomodates an optical flow sensor, a 1D lidar, a circuit board camera, and 
                    a downward facing FPV camera. The entire mount is secured to an arm of the drone using a dove-tail. This allows us to easily remove and 
                    reattach the mount when we need to remove the avionics during transportation or even when mounting the avionics. A clevis and cotter pin 
                    is used to lock the plate part of the mount. The mount was designed in SolidWorks, and was toleranced properly to ensure a tight dove-tail fit
                    and also a tight fit around the carbon fiber tube arm to minimize vibrations. 
                </p>

            <h4>Manufacturing and Assembly</h4>
                <p>Besides designing, I also conducted multiple design review for other avionic and camera mounts. I also helped
                   lead carbon fiber wet layups, and machining to construct the drone. Below is a tube drilling jig that I created on the mill.
                   I also worked with mechanical tools like rachets and pliers to fasten the drone together, and also applied medium strength loctite
                   so the bolts do not come off loose.

            <h2>Articus Maximus</h2>
            <p>In my 1B term at university, we were challenged with designing a robot using EV3 parts to solve a problem.
               I, alongside my 3 friends, created a robot that executes drawing instructions to help mechanical engineers 
               communicate design ideas with more clarity and ease. This solution was cheaper than using a printer which requires purchasing
               and replacing cartridges. Instead, with this robot anyone can use any writing tool like pen and pencil to sketch images.  
            </p>
            <img src="./img/articus-group.jpg" alt="The team!">
            <p>Proper engineering process was used to define the scope of the project, brainstorm ideas, and collectively decide the most 
               effective design approach. The need statement for this project was "a need exists to draw an image by moving a drawing instrument
               in the x, y, and z-axes while keeping production cost under $100 CAD." Throughout the process, the group performed and documented 
               software and mechanical integration tests to ensure project timelines would be met and the goals would be achieved.
            </p>
            <h4>Base design and y-axis</h4>
            <p>
                The frame of the robot is constructed out of Tetrix Prime beams and connectors. The base frame is integrated with the 
                y-axis because the sketching bed is actuated along the y-axis using a linear bearing. A rack-and-pinion mechanism is used 
                to translate the sketching bed. The bed is supported by 2 aluminum rods and a linear bearing to ensure smooth sliding.
                An EV3 stepper motor and pinion gear is used to move the bed (both not shown in the image below). A rack gear was designed and 
                3D printed, and glued to the arcylic sketching platform.  The sketching platform was lasercut. 2 custom mounting fixtures are designed
                to secure the sketching platform to the linear bearing shown in the underside view. The sketching platform is glued to the fixture. 
                We also ran into the issue of misalignment of the rack gears not being perfectly parallel which limited the range of motion along the y-axis. 
                I added a slot cut-out on the sketching platform where the rack gear would fix so that the rack gear can be glued accurately to the acrylic platform.
            </p>

            <h4>Integration and User Interface</h4>
            <p>On the integration side, I involved in assembling the frame, mounting the stepper motors and proposing design solutions. We learned that integration is 
               DIFFICULT. It is essential to start testing early on so that you can catch simple mistakes before they become too costly. Besides integration, I also wrote 
               the Robot C software for the user interface in the EV3 brick which can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Miekale/ArticusMaximus">github.com/Miekale/ArticusMaximus</a>.

            <h2>APC Server Tray</h2>
            <p>During my co-op at Borrum Energy Solutions, my boss asked me to design a tray to mount the work servers 
               inside an <a href="https://www.apc.com/ca/en/product/AR3100/apc-netshelter-sx-server-rack-enclosure-42u-black-1991h-x-600w-x-1070d-mm/">APC server rack</a> that was donated to the office. 
               Each tray had to support a maximum load of 60kg. This is a non-commercial product.
            </p>
            <p>
                To design this tray, I performed the following actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Obtained dimensions of the server rack in the office by measuring and researching the rack model</li>
                    <li>Designed the server tray using SolidWorks sheetmetal and produced a manufacturing drawing</li>
                    <li>Performed hand calculations and verified the stresses using Ansys FEA</li>
                    <li>Chose to use 1/8" 44W steel due to cheaper cost and greater strength based on quotes
                        and stress analysis
                    </li>
                    <li>Communicated with the supplier to manufacture the server and addressed concerns regarding the drawing</li>
                    <li>Obtained a 2.5 safety factor, and added side flanges along the length to minimize deflection</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Sweeping Robot</h2>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of life that university students overlook is cleaning their home! This served as a key 
               motivation for this project. At its current stage, the robot is designed as a prototype focusing on testing the mechanical and 
               electrical systems, with fully autonomous functionality falling outside the project's scope.  
            </p>
            <h4>System Architecture</h4>
                <p>The simplest method to control the robot at its prototyping stage was through user input. The robot's drivetrain would be controlled 
                    by an operator using PC keys. For wireless control, bluetooth was selected as the cheapest and most efficient protocol.
                    Arduino Uno was the chosen micro-controller, and a HC-05 module was used to establish communication between the PC and Arduino.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/sweeper-diagram.png" alt="">
            <h4>Hardware and Electrical</h4>
                <p>A DC TT motor was chosen because it satisfied the torque requirements, was cheap, and is easy to integrate with Arduino. A L298N H-bridge is used to feed PWM input to the DC motor. 
                As for the power supply, a 12V DC power supply is used instead of batteries because it is cheaper and easier to prototype with. 
                </p>
                <p>The DC motor was rated for 6V but the power supply provides 12V. I needed to find the PWM value that would provide 6V to the motor.                          
                I tested various PWM duty cycle values and measured the motor voltage using a multimeter. Using linear regression
                I was able to narrow down the duty cycle value to '80' to output almost 6V without exceeding that value. The results are shown below.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/sweeper-excel.png" alt="">
                   
            <h4>Mechanical</h4>
                <p>
                    The frame was designed in SolidWorks. There is a main baseplate on which all electronics are mounted to. For the drivetrain, there are 2
                    forward wheels, and a single caster wheel is placed at the rear. For the sweeping mechanism, a singular beam is placed at the front 
                    and a sweeping bad is attached under the beam. This beam is raised and lowered using a servo. The beam, base, and motor mounts are 3D 
                    printed out of PETG.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/sweeper-base-render.png" alt="">
                <p>To cover the electronics and wires, a PETG cover is designed. The cover features cantilever snapfit hooks that latches it to the base 
                   for quick and easy installation. In the future, I would advise using PLA instead of PETG for snapfits for more stiffness. 
                   Slot cutouts are added for cooling and viewing the Arduino and bluetooth LEDs to verify that the system is operating.
